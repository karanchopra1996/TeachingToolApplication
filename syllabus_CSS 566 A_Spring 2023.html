<p>This course covers theories, principles, and practices designed to enable project managers and other related stakeholders to assess, choose and use appropriate frameworks, tools, techniques, and metrics to guide software projects toward successful completion or termination.</p>
<h3>Course Overview</h3>
<p>This course is about "software management" to manage the systems that produce software-enabled systems. This course covers the science and practice of planning, executing, releasing, and evolving software-enabled systems. It covers theories, principles, and practices designed to enable project/product managers, developers, and other related stakeholders to guide software projects toward successful completion or termination and manage the highly complex software-enabled systems we are building today. This course emphasizes comparing and contrasting different approaches, listening perspectives from Industry Experts in Guest Speaker Series, and making choices based on particular software projects' specific context.</p>
<p>Topics cover theory and practices related to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project planning</strong>, including topics such as ideation, market research, feasibility, requirements gathering, risk management, architectural design, budgeting and staffing, and top-level scheduling</li>
<li><strong>Project execution</strong>, including topics such as costing, scheduling, specifying, implementing, testing and quality assurance, coordinating processes, synchronization, dependency management, and continuous integration</li>
<li><strong>Project release</strong>, including topics such as software release life cycles, release planning, triage, driving closure, release stages, and continuous deployment</li>
</ul>
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>The defined learning objectives for this course are described here. Each instance of this course will, of necessity, adjust the particular focus across these objectives, but the goal (in general) is to cover them all.</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>
<p><span>This course is not graded on a curve.&nbsp;</span><span>It is feasible (although unlikely) that all students can receive the highest grade.&nbsp;Grading System for Graduate Students&nbsp;(Canvas works with percentage).</span></p>
<p><span>Grades consist of the major components as shown by the percentages in the table below and will be determined as objectively as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>Assignments will be given consistently through the quarter and will support the active learning style of the class. The product we will build will be due during finals week.</span></p>
<p><span>At any time I will be happy to consult with you on how you are doing in the class relative to grade ranges.</span></p>
<h3>Canvas</h3>
<p><span>We will use Canvas to track grades, electronically submit projects and for general communication and announcements.</span></p>
<h3>Assignment Submissions</h3>
<p>Assignments due dates and times will be clearly shown in Canvas.&nbsp; Past a short period of time (~15 minutes) past the due date/time, homework will not be accepted. Extenuating circumstances should be discussed with the professor as early as possible.</p>
<h3>Missed Classes, Make-Up and Late Policy</h3>
<p>You are expected to coordinate with your peers regarding notes, classwork, and assignments should you miss a class.</p>
<p>Work is not accepted late (past ~15 minutes), nor are there makeups for any work, unless for reasons of physical health, bereavement, University business, or select legal and governmental obligations. Please see me if something like this comes up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extensions must be requested in a timely manner.&nbsp; For instance, unless you are physically unable to send an email, you should notify me reasonably close to the exam time if you're too ill to take the exam.&nbsp; If you have University business that conflicts with an exam, you need to notify me immediately upon learning of the conflict.&nbsp; Any non-timeliness of an extension request is a prima facie reason for me to reject the requested extension.</p>
<p><strong>No exam dates will be changed</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>for any reason except illness, bereavement, University business, and select legal and governmental obligations (or similar reasons).&nbsp; If you believe I will let you take an exam on another date because you have a very good reason that doesn’t fit the above categories, you are mistaken.&nbsp; Please save us all the grief of receiving a zero for missing the exam:<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>arrange now</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to take a different class or alter your schedule.</p>
<h3>Class Policies</h3>
<p>You may use notebook PCs, PDAs, tape recorders, and other equipment to improve your ability to take notes and understand class lectures and discussion&nbsp;subject the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>All recordings and other media captured during class time are for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>personal use only</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and may not be sold, traded, posted, shared, or exchanged without explicit permission. Such use may constitute a violation of intellectual property laws.</li>
<li>Using electronic equipment for communicating and/or performing work not related to class activities disrupts not only your concentration but also those around you and<span>&nbsp;</span><u>your instructor’s</u>. You may be asked to immediately turn off equipment and/or leave the classroom.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>You are expected to provide original work based on your own effort for this course. You may<span>&nbsp;</span><u>not</u><span>&nbsp;</span>use case studies or past materials from this class as resource. You will be expected to participate as an equal member of a project team in any group projects. You will receive a zero for any exam or coursework for which you are discovered cheating, facilitating, fabricating, or plagiarizing. You may be referred to the University for further action.</p>
<h2>Access and Accommodations</h2>
<p>"Your experience in this class is important to me. If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course.</p>
<p>If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but are not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at 425-352-5307 or&nbsp;uwbdrs@uw.edu. DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, your instructor(s), and DRS. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law." (<span>Disability Resources for Students Syllabus Statement</span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span>)</p>

<p>For any student who are encountering urgent and overwhelming difficulties, please contact the Suicide Prevention Hotline (1-800-273-8255) or the UWB CARE Team (<span>https://www.uwb.edu/studentaffairs/care-team</span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span>).</p>
<h3><span>Protocols Regarding Internet Issues</span></h3>
<p>Because the class will have lessons taught remotely, we are all dependent on the Internet.&nbsp; Here is the protocol we will follow to handle Internet issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instructor Internet issues during class:&nbsp; If my (the instructor's) Internet goes out in class, please remain connected for 10 minutes.&nbsp; If I can get things up and running during that time, I'll continue class as normal.&nbsp; If after 10 minutes I have not returned, assume that class is cancelled and that I will post a recorded lecture on Canvas for the remainder of the class at my earliest convenience.&nbsp; I will try to message the class from my smart phone if my mobile Internet will be working.</li>
<li>Student Internet issues during class:&nbsp; If you lose Internet access:
<ul>
<li>During a regular class, try to join us as soon as you can.&nbsp; If there are activities you missed that you want to discuss with me, please do so at your earliest convenience.</li>
<li>While submitting a non-exam assignment, please let me know and I'll unlock the assignment to enable you to submit it.&nbsp; When you do submit it, please include a screenshot of your file's Properties window (Windows) or Get Info window (Mac) that shows that the modification date of the file is before the assignment's due date.</li>
<li>While submitting an exam/quiz, please let me know and I will work with your specific situation.&nbsp; This may involve screenshots showing the file's modification date (as described earlier for non-exam assignments) or other accommodations.&nbsp; If your Internet is out for an extended period (e.g., days), I may give you a make-up oral exam over Zoom.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are dropped from a Canvas exam/quiz while you are taking it, when you return, Canvas will put you where you were left off.</p>
<h3>Inclement Weather Policy</h3>
<p>Call<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>(206)-547-4636</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(206-547-INFO) to see if University of Washington, Seattle, Bothell, and Tacoma campuses are open and operating.</p>
<h3><span>Class Cancellation Policy</span></h3>
<p>If classes are cancelled because of weather or other situations that impact the entire campus, please see the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>UW Bothell main page</span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span>. You will probably want to<span>&nbsp;</span><span>sign-up for UW Alert</span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span><span>&nbsp;</span>to be notified of any emergency situations. The<span>&nbsp;</span><span>campus emergency page</span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span><span>&nbsp;</span>also contains helpful information. For instructor-related cancellations (for instance, if I'm sick), I will post an announcement on Canvas. For Internet issues that disrupt the class, see the "Protocols Regarding Internet Issues" section above.</p>
